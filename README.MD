500miles
------------------
### A music player that plays a song randomly from a selected set of music files, when you start auto running.
Easy to customize it to play your own music. Simply replace the 3 included Files or add your own!

## Install
- Go to your WoW Installation folder and navigate to ./Interface/addons/
- Extract the files so that you have a folder in ./addons/ called 500miles which contains the .toc, .lua and .mp3 files.
`Example: E:\World of Warcraft\_classic_\Interface\AddOns\500miles\500miles.lua`
- It plays music on the "Ambience" channel, so turn that up if you have turned it down.
## Customize
- Replace the included files with your files or put your own music in the folder and edit the musicList array in Line 4 in 500miles.lua
`Example: local musicList = {"myFavouriteSong1.mp3", "myCatSnoring.mp3"}`
